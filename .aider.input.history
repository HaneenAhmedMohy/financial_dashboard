+/ask I'm building a real-time financial dashboard application using Elixir (Phoenix) for the backend and Svelte for the frontend. The backend will connect to the Finnhub WebSocket API to stream live stock data for selected companies (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, JPM, BAC, V, AMZN, WMT, MCD). I want to establish a basic project structure now and set up communication between Phoenix and Svelte — for example, Phoenix sending a test WebSocket message and Svelte receiving it. Please help me scaffold this communication (you can simulate Finnhub data for now).
